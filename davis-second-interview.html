     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>All right.  Mr. Simpson, I'm going to return to the topic of Prevezon.  Let me know if I'm accurately summarizing the scope of work you're describing.  I think you've described three main areas so far.  First is that you were investigating Prevezon's side of the story to see if it was credible; the second is you were investigating Bill Browder's ties to the U.S. and related subpoena issues; and the third is that you were investigating Bill Browder's Russian businesses.  Is that correct?</p>

     Mr. Levy

    <p>I think he said a lot more than that, but go ahead.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>I listed the main topics.  That's where we left off.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    <p>I don't think that's the main topics either, but go ahead.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Is that a yes-or-no question?  I think those are three things I covered, but I covered a lot of stuff.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>With the information that you gathered in those and related efforts, what did you do with the information once you obtained it?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Well, the first thing you do is you give it to the lawyers and, you know, when appropriate you give it to reporters, you know, put it in court filings.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>So is it correct, then, people associated with Fusion did communicate with journalists about the Prevezon case and the information you found out about Mr. Browder?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Yes.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And did Fusion engage in these communications with the media on its own accord or were you directed or authorized to do so?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>In litigation support, you know, basically the cases that we work on frequently get some media attention.  So it's always part of a litigation engagement that if you're the guy that does the research, you're going to end up talking to reporters because they're going to ask questions about, you know, information from the case.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    <p>Just make sure you answer his question.  Was it done?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>That's part of what the lawyers hire you to do and that's what they instruct you to do.  The way it generally happens is the lawyer gets a call from a reporter who wants to write a story about the case and he answers the questions or gives them a quote and then he instructs me to give him background information.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>So then was it typically done on a case-by-case basis or did you have blanket authorization regardless of specific interactions with the attorneys?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>These things evolved over time.  So in the beginning of the case when you're new to a subject you're generally fielding&mdash;you generally get requests from the lawyers to answer a specific question that a reporter has.  So the reporter will call and they'll want to know whatever, where the house was in Colorado, and he'll say somewhere in Aspen, ask Glenn.  Then he'll send him to me or he'll send me to them.  Later on when you get where you've gathered a mass of information that covers a whole wide range of topics and, you know, if there's more coverage, you know, they will direct you to answer questions for the reporters covering the case.  They won't tell you on an individual basis talk to so-and-so.  It's a little of both.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Was Fusion then paid for these communications with the media?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>We were compensated for our litigation support and as part of that we were directed to talk to the media.  So in the fundamental sense yes, we were.  Specifically paid for individual conversations, I don't think so.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>Do you bill hourly?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>It depends on the case.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>On this case?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I think we did on this case.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>So did you bill for conversations with the press on this case?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I'm sorry to say I don't know.  I probably did not.  Generally speaking, what I would bill for would be to attend events where there would be press.  So if I was at a court hearing&mdash;most of the press was around court hearings.  So I would go to a court hearing with the lawyers and there would be reporters there.  So part of what I was billing for was answering their questions.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And with which news organizations did Fusion communicate in relation to the Prevezon case?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I will try to remember them.  It was the major news organizations that were covering the litigation.  Usually it was their courthouse or legal reporters.  So it was Bloomberg, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, probably Reuters, Legal 360.  I'm sure there were a handful of others.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Was the Financial Times possibly one of them?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Yes.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Politico?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>They approached us with&mdash;they had been getting information from Bill Browder.  He had alleged to them that we were part of a big campaign on Capitol Hill and that we were engaged in lobbying and that it was all designed to affect legislation or smear him or Sergei Magnitsky.  So eventually we did end up dealing with that, but I don't remember whether we dealt with them prior to that.  I don't think they covered the case prior to that.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>What about NBC?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>We would have&mdash;I'm sorry.  Yes.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And the New Republic?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I think so.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And do you recall what information you provided to each or is that too into the weeds?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I don't know if it's in the weeds, but generally speaking, the work&mdash;we provided information about the work that I had done about William Browder's credibility.  The whole case ended up&mdash;when I said when he declined to appear voluntarily as I am here and explain things, you know, it ended up being an issue of why he didn't want to talk.  So a lot of it was about his credibility, about his account of his activities in Russia, about his history of tax avoidance, all these things.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Did Fusion provide the media information alleging that Browder had illicitly engineered the purchase of 133 million shares of Gazprom?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I don't know for sure, but we certainly did research on that issue.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And you described investigating these series of issues.  How did you acquire the information in the course of this investigate?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>We used the methods that I've described here today.  We pulled court records, we pulled corporate records, we, you know, pulled real estate records, SEC securities filings, that sort of thing.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And was any of the information you provided to the media information that wasn't the result of your own research but that had been passed along to you by Baker Hostetler or Prevezon?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I think the answer to that is yes, but I'm struggling to think of a specific example.</p>
    <p>I was saying earlier, the lawyers did a lot of the research too.  So there was obviously a sharing of research where, you know, we were feeding research to them and they were housing a central repository of research and then the research would become memoranda and given in court filings.  In a lot of these cases we were giving people court filings.  So the information was mixed together from various sources.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Did Fusion independently verify the information provided by Baker Hostetler or Prevezon or in this circumstance was it assumed to be reliable given your work with them?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>We certainly did not independently verify everything that the lawyers generated in the case.  That would have been an enormous task and it would have made no sense.</p>
    <p>I just want to stress that I've worked with Baker Hostetler for&mdash;you know, since 2009, so I guess going on over eight years, and they're very good lawyers and very conservative.  So if they provided me with information that they had gathered, I would have been confident&mdash;I was confident in the quality of their work.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And did Prevezon or Baker Hostetler ever direct Fusion to relay to the media information that they had provided to Fusion?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I'm sorry.  Can you say that again.</p>

   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Did Baker Hostetler or Prevezon direct Fusion to relay to the media information that they had provided to you?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I don't specifically recall an example of that, but I think as a general sort of operating principle we were working at their direction and they were providing us with, you know, case information.  So I think so, but I just don't have an idea.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And did anyone at Fusion or perhaps Mr. Baumgartner review Russian documents related to the Prevezon matter?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Yes.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Do any&mdash;</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Most of them were Russian court documents.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Do any Fusion employees or associates speak Russian?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>No.  I'll qualify that.  Depends on how you define associate.  Edward isn't an employee of the company, but he speaks Russian.  He's a subcontractor.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Aside from Mr. Baumgartner, do you have any other support from Russian-speaking individuals in reviewing the Russian documents?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Not in my company, at least not that I can recall.  There was other Russian speakers I think that were engaged by Baker Hostetler in various situations, like translators, Russian bilingual lawyers, that sort of thing.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Do you remember the names of any of those people?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Anatoli, whose last name I can't really pronounce, was a New York-based English-Russian court translator.  He was mostly a courtroom translator.  So I don't know whether he&mdash;I really don't know the extent of their other involvement with other people in these things.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>Can I just back up before we get too far afield of this.  I want to follow up on an answer that you gave earlier.  You described your interactions with the press as primarily being directed to answer questions, in other words, the contact as being initiated by the press.  That's my understanding of how you described it.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    <p>I don't think that's a complete summary of what he said.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  My question is were there instances where you were initiating contact with the press or pitching stories to the press?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Sure.  I mean, the range of things that you would do, you know, again, it would evolve.  In the beginning you were going to a lot of hearings and a lot of legal reporters are showing up and you're mostly answering their questions.  Depending on the setting, you know, you might get a question for the lawyers like is anyone from Reuters going to be there and you would reach out to Reuters and say are you guys sending someone to this hearing.  So there was definitely some reach out like that.  Then we would also talk to reporters, you know, generally covering issues of corruption or law or Russia or whatever and say, you know, we're involved in a really weird court case, you might be interested in this.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>So is it fair to say that part of your job, then, was to locate reporters who would write about these matters from a point of view that was advantageous to your client?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Yes, but I think we should note here that William Browder is an especially aggressive media self-promoter and promoter of his story.  So for much of this case it was reactive and we were constantly besieged with reporters pursuing negative stories about Prevezon, the events of the Prevezon case that had been given to them by William Browder.  So, you know, unhappily, I would say, you know, a lot of what we were doing was simply responding to his wild allegations, unsupported wild allegations.</p>
    <p>There were certainly moments, particularly concerning his unwillingness to appear for a deposition, where we said to some reporters, hey, guy, you know, he's just dodged his third subpoena, you might want to write about this, it's pretty funny.  In fact, you know, the third one he ran down a street in Manhattan in the middle of a blizzard to get away from our process servers, but that one we actually had them film it.</p>
    <p>So, you know, did we want to get that covered, did we think it was important that people know that this guy was unwilling to appear in court in public under oath to talk about the story that he'd been selling for years about his activities in Russia?  Yeah, we wanted people to know that.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Other than the media and Baker Hostetler, did Fusion provide any information regarding the Prevezon matter to any other third parties?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I don't have a specific recollection of doing so.  If there's a specific incident that you'd like to ask about I'd be happy to try and answer that.  I don't remember.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>We'll get into that a little bit more.</p>
    <p>Also to go back to the translator you mentioned, you said Anatoli and that you didn't know how to pronounce&mdash;</p>

    <p>I've been&mdash;in the Prevezon case I interacted with him.  I think&mdash;again, this has unhelpfully been distorted by William Browder into some sort of economic relationship or conspiracy or something.  I don't have any economic relations with him.  You know, I've bumped into him over the years around town.  So, you know, the only thing that I specifically recall having done with him was interacting for a brief period on the Prevezon case.</p>

    <p>Let's be clear, I'm sure we did not do business together, but I do work on areas of the world where he's from, Central Asia, former Soviet Union, and he is, as I'm sure you've seen, a guy around town who knows lots of people who cover this stuff.  I met him in connection with some stories I was doing on Kazakhstan at the Wall Street Journal.  That's the kind of context I've bumped into him over the years.  He's told me various things and I think I even met one of his clients at one point, but it wasn't a business thing.  I don't think I was doing any work.  I was just networking.</p>

I don't recall anyone ever saying to me you're not doing X, Y, or Z.  They may have.  I just don't recall.  The lane that I was in was the court case and this fight over whether Browder would have to testify, which morphed then into this fight over whether&mdash;you know, his allegations that John Moscow had a conflict of interest.  So I was very focused on that.  These other issues came up two plus years into the case and he was clearly dealing with them, but I don't recall anyone sort of giving me a specific explanation, you know, of what he was doing.</p>

    <p>I was not introduced to her originally.  The original way that she was&mdash;it came up in my conversations with Mark Cymrot and other Baker lawyers was as the person who had hired them who had the information about the extortion case against Demetri Baranovsky.  It was represented to me by Mark Cymrot that she handled that matter and was familiar with the prosecution of Demetri Baranovsky and very well versed in the events of the extortion.  So, you know, that's how I learned of her and I think that's probably&mdash;our first interactions were probably about that subject.</p>

    <p>Well, the first one was just an obligatory client dinner which, you know, when you work on a legal case you get invited to dinner with the clients.  The one in D.C. was more of a social thing.  It wasn't&mdash;she was at it, but it wasn't really about the case.  It was just a bunch of Mark Cymrot's friends.  You know, the editor of the Washington Post book section was there and his wife who's a well-known author were also there.  I can't remember who else was there.  But anyway, she sat at the other end of the table from me and, you know, as I said, she doesn't really speak English and I don't speak Russian.  So not a lot of chit-chat.</p>

    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>He worked on his movie doing&mdash;essentially as I understand it and recall it, he was asked to help find a place where they could show this movie.  William Browder likes to use the press, but he doesn't like anyone talking freely about him or raising questions about the story of his activities in Russia.  So when this movie came together they were going to screen it in Europe and he hired the meanest libel firm in London which has previously sued me on behalf of Saudi billionaires and&mdash;unsuccessfully I might add, and he threatened to file libel cases against the people who were daring to offer to host a showing of this film.</p>
    <p>So, as you know, they don't have the First Amendment in Europe.  So he was able to successfully suppress the showings of this film which questioned his credibility and whether&mdash;the truth of his story and his activities in Russia.  So Chris came up with the idea of showing it at the Newseum which is dedicated to the First Amendment and where they don't have much time for libel lawyers and people trying to suppress free speech</p>

    <p>I believe that I mentioned it to some journalists in terms of showing up.  I don't believe I&mdash;I just don't remember whether I tried to get anyone to write anything about it, but if I did I would have had good reason to because it was all about William Browder's credibility which was the subject that we were hotly litigating in New York and I had been on this&mdash;you know, we had been on this, you know, multi-year effort to get him to answer questions about his activities in Russia.  So it was the central issue in the Prevezon case.</p>

    <author>
     Mr. Davis

    <p>So you mentioned Mr. Cooper was involved in establishing this screening.  Do you know how he came to be hired by Prevezon or HRAGI or whoever?</p>

    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I know a little.  As I was saying earlier, I've known Chris from Wall Street Journal days and I refer business to him.  I know this doesn't fit with the Browder theory of the case, but I don't do a lot of public relations work and I refer, you know, public relations jobs to other people, friends.</p>
    <p>So when the trial was approaching in the Prevezon case I kept telling the lawyers you guys have to hire a PR guy, I'm not going to do this, it's just too much work.  So we were trying to find PR people and he was one of the people that I recommended as a trial PR guy.  From there I don't have a clear sense of how he ended up working on the movie, but it wouldn't be surprising if they had his name from the previous referral.</p>

    <p>The meeting that I was aware of that I remember hearing about was a meeting that actually didn't happen which was some meeting that Mark Cymrot was supposed to have.  It's possible that he was going to meet some Congressman.  It's possible that I was told about other meetings by some of these people that we're discussing, but I don't specifically remember hearing about other meetings.

   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I was.  She had trouble getting a visa and the lawyers&mdash;there was some drama over whether she could get a visa.  This would have been a recurring issue in the case.  You know, our lawyers believed that the Justice Department was interfering with her visas because they wanted to inhibit her from collaborating with us on the case, but I don't have any independent knowledge of her visa issues.  I just remember that was an issue.</p>
    <p>I remember that at the last minute she got a visa to come to this Appellate Court hearing on June 9th in New York, and that was the way that she persuaded them to give her a visa was that she needed to attend a hearing which was on an appeal of a District Court ruling related to the disqualification motion that had been filed by William Browder against Baker Hostetler after he was ordered to give testimony.</p>
    <p>So that's the history of that court hearing, which was after the Court said he couldn't get out of the subpoena and he had to give testimony, he then triggered a new delay in his testimony by filing a disqualification motion.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I saw her the next day in court at this hearing and I'm sure we exchanged greetings, but, as I say, she speaks Russian and I speak English.  I think she was with Anatoli and she left afterwards.  I know she didn't tell me any other plans she had.</p>

You know, as a sort of question of counterintelligence and just general investigation of Russian methods and that sort of thing, I think that's a reasonable interpretation.</p>

    <p>Probably.  I think we all exchanged mutual expressions of surprise.  I think I talked to Paul Levine, a lawyer at Baker Hostetler.  I'm sure I discussed it with Ed Baumgartner, Mark Cymrot.  You know, if anyone knew about it they certainly didn't confess it to me.</p>

    <p>I've been told by a source that&mdash;actually, I was told by a source that there was some reason to believe he had ties to the Russian government, and he directed me to a newspaper article which said that he had connections to a guy on the West Coast named Boris Goldstein who has been linked historically to Soviet Russian intelligence.  Beyond that I don't have any&mdash;I don't have any information.</p>

    <p>I met him in connection with this case.  We've never had any kind of social or other relations beyond chatting in courthouses and that sort of thing, sitting in restaurants waiting for a hearing to start.</p>

    <p>As I understood it, he was recruited off the rack basically as a certified&mdash;a translator who had courtroom experience in New York who was qualified to do sort of technical-legal type translation work.  He, to my knowledge, didn't have a pre-existing relationship with Ms. Veselnitskaya or Prevezon.  That's my understanding to this day.</p>
