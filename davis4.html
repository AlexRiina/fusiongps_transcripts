     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    We'll go back on the record.  It's 5:43 p.m.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Mr. Simpson, could you walk us through your itinerary to the best you remember it from June 8th through 10th of 2016, especially any interactions you had with Prevezon team members during those three days?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Beyond what he's discussed today?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Yes.

     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I took the train to New York.  I don't recall, but I may have had other business.  I don't remember.  I think there was a dinner.  I went back to my hotel, went to bed.  Got up the next morning.  I don't remember the sequence, but I remember meeting with Weber Shandwick, the PR firm, about preparations for -- I think we expected there was going to be a trial.  I think that's what it was about.  It might have been about the press coverage of the hearing.  I just don't remember.  I went to the hearing and I think -- if I remember the sequence correctly, I went to the hearing, then I had the meeting with those guys, the Weber Shandwick guys, and then I hightailed it home.  My son's junior prom was that night or senior prom and I was under some pressure to go home and be a dad.

   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    And then on the 10th, that first day back in D.C.?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I don't think that was my first day back.  I was back the evening of the 9th.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Sorry.  The first full day.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I think it was a weekend.  So I don't know what I was doing.  Probably just relaxing.  I went to the dinner, it was at a restaurant called Barcelona up on Wisconsin Avenue, it was a social occasion.  I brought my wife, other people brought their wives.  We talked about books and other other nongermane topics.  It was just a social occasion.

   <hr data-content="Exhibit 6 was marked for identification."/>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    I'm going to show you an exhibit.  I think we're on 6.  We understand these are meeting notes.  Do these phrases about -- including Mr. Browder mean anything to you or relate to any of the research that you conducted or otherwise aware of regarding Mr. Browder?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    When say "meetings notes," meeting notes about what meeting?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    These are the meeting notes from the June 9th meeting at Trump Tower.  These are Mr. Manafort's notes or they're contemporaneous.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I could tell -- obviously you know who Bill Browder is.  Cyprus Offshore, Bill Browder's structure, you know, investment -- Hermitage Capital, his hedge fund, set up numerous companies in Cyprus to engage in inward investment into Russia, which is a common structure, both partially for tax reasons but also to have entities outside of Russia, you know, managing specific investments.  I can only tell you I assume that's what that references.  I don't know what the 133 million --
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    Can I interrupt?  And you know that from research that you did and provided to --
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Yes.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Let him finish.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    -- research that you did and provided to Baker Hostetler and their client?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson:  Yes.  There was a -- I can elaborate a little bit.  Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    part of the research into how Hermitage Capital worked we looked at various things, their banking relationships, the way they structured their investments in Russia.  I don't remember how many, but there was a large number of shell companies in Cyprus that were used to hold the investments of individual clients of Hermitage.  So one of the things we discovered from that was the likely identities of some of Hermitage's clients.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Do any of the other entries in here mean anything to you in light of the research you've conducted or what you otherwise know about Mr. Browder?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I'm going to -- I can only speculate about some of these things.  I mean, sometimes --
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Don't speculate.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Just would be guesses.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Okay.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I can skip down a couple.  So "Value in Cyprus as inter," I don't know what that means.  "Illici," I don't know what that means.  "Active sponsors of RNC," I don't know what that means.  "Browder hired Joanna Glover" is a mistaken reference to Juliana Glover, who was Dick Cheney's press secretary during the Iraq war and associated with another foreign policy controversy.  "Russian adoptions by American families" I assume is a reference to the adoption issue.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    And by "adoption issue" do you mean Russia prohibiting U.S. families from adopting Russian babies as a measure in response to the Magnitsky act?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I assume so.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    The information here, is this generally consistent with the type of information you or Baker Hostetler were providing about Mr. Browder and his activities?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Can you repeat that question.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Is the information here, to the best you can decipher it, consistent with the information that you and Baker Hostetler and HRAGI were relaying to other parties about Mr. Browder's activities?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    He's just told you that a lot of what's here he doesn't know what it means, he doesn't have knowledge or recollection as to these terms.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    The parts you do recognize.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Couple of the items touch on things that I worked on, Cyprus, Bill Browder.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    I'm going to jump back to the Russia investigation.  You'd mentioned before you've had some subcontractors that you've worked with long enough that you call them super subs; is that correct?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Yes.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Orbis or Mr. Steele, is that one such super sub in your opinion?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    It's a loose term.  We don't have a list of super subs.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    Is he one of them?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    There is no list.  So I can't tell you if he's one of them.  He's a reliable subcontractor who's worked with us in the past and we've been very satisfied with the quality of his work.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Just to reiterate, I think as you described these super subs earlier loosely, even with some of these super subs Mr. Simpson said that he would talk about clients only on a need-to-know basis even with the super subs, so-called.

     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Beyond the memoranda prepared by Mr. Steele, did Fusion create any other work product relating to this investigation?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Which investigation?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    The investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    In addition to what?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Sorry.  The investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    I'm sorry.  Just repeat the whole question.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Sure.  In addition to the memoranda compiled by Mr. Steele, did Fusion itself create any other work product as part of this investigation?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    I just want to make sure there's no confusion.  It wasn't Fusion that created the memoranda.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Right, but it was a subcontractor giving it back to Fusion.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    That's correct.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    With that understanding, did Fusion create any work product of its own?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Yes.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    And can you describe what type of work product that was?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I believe I described it before.  We do a lot of public records research, things that are in the news, things that are in court documents.  We summarize those things and try to document, you know, and attach them to the underlying source material.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    So you create sort of summary memoranda of those documents?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Yes.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Okay.  And to whom is that distributed?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy:  Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    a general matter?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Well, within the course of this investigation.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Inasmuch as that answer calls for client communications the answer might be privileged, might touch on obligations Mr. Simpson has.  So he's not going to answer that question.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    Did you provide work product to your client?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    Again, the answer to that question might implicate privilege or his obligations.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Is the version of the Steele memoranda that was published by BuzzFeed identical to the version that Orbis provided Fusion?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    To my knowledge, yes.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    The version published by BuzzFeed contains several redactions, not merely the ones by Mr. Gubarev, G-U-B-A-R-E-V, that were later added.  Were those redactions in the versions Mr. Steele provided to you?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    So wait.  You're asking about the version in Exhibit 3?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Right.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    And you're asking if the redactions that appear here were delivered to Fusion?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Right.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    No.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Do you know who added those redactions?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    No.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Did any version of the memoranda list source and subsource names rather than referring to sources anonymously?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I'm not sure I understand the question.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Davis: In the version that we have as an exhibit obviously it doesn't give identifying information for sources, it says source Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    subsources, things like that.  Was there ever a version that listed the actual source names rather than substituting them?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    These are the versions that we received.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    They're what?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    These are the memos that we received.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Those are the memos you received.  Okay.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    But he's asking if you received any other memos that listed the sources?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    He did not -- what I think he said is that he did not receive any versions of these memos that listed the sources.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    Okay.  Did you receive any other documentation from Mr. Steele that listed the sources?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I don't want to get into source information.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Again, I don't want to repeat questions that have been asked, but I don't want to unintentionally omit anything.  Did the version provided to the FBI include all source names?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I don't know that there was a version provided to the FBI.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    When Mr. Steele first met with the FBI in the summer of 2016 do you know if he provided the first memoranda that he created?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    He's already answered that question.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    No, I don't know.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Do you know if he provided any other memoranda to the FBI on a rolling basis at all at any point?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    He's answered that question too.
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I don't know.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    So I'd like to go back to Exhibit 4, I believe.  On page 3, paragraph 18 Mr. Steele's attorneys are describing the December memoranda and they state "The Defendants" -- again, that's Mr. Steele and Orbis -- "continued to receive unsolicited intelligence on the matters covered by the pre-election memoranda after the U.S. presidential election and the conclusion of the assignment for Fusion."
  They reiterate this point on Exhibit 5 on page 4.  Request 11 asks "Please state whether such intelligence was actively sought by the Defendant" --
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Where are you at?
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Page 4, request 11.  It states "Please state whether such intelligence was actively sought by the second Defendant or merely received as presently pleaded."  The response they say is "Such intelligence was not actively sought, it was merely received."
  Did anyone -- are you aware of who sent this unsolicited intelligence to Mr. Steele?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    No.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Could you describe his methods of compiling the dossier a little more?  I think before you described field interviews.  He seems to be talking about unsolicited information coming to him rather than information he sought out?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I can try.  When you're doing field information gathering you have a network of people, sources.  It's not like a light switch that you turn on and off, these are people you work with.  So they call you and tell you stuff.  You know, you don't close the window and stop answering phone calls, you know, when the engagement ends.  So I assume this is stuff that came in straggle, whatever you call it.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    To the best of your knowledge, did Mr. Steele pay any of his sources or subsources in the memoranda for information?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I don't know.  I think there's been a little bit of confusion I would like to clear up.  Some people were saying that he was paying people for information.  I don't know whether he does or not, but that's not basically how I understand field operations to work.  You commission people to gather information for you rather than sort of paying someone for a document or to sit for an interview or something like that.  That's not how I understand it works.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    To make sure I understand, are you saying you don't pay for particular information, you would have an established financial arrangement with someone?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    If he did at all, but I did not ask and he did not share that information.  He did not invoice me for any such.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Did Mr. Steele ever discuss his opinion of Mr. Trump with you?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    We didn't discuss our political views of Mr. Trump, I don't think, at least not that I specifically remember, if that's what you mean.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    That is.
  If I recall correctly, you said earlier that once Fusion had exhausted public documentary sources you turned to Mr. Steele and some other subcontractors for human intelligence; is that correct?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    Yeah, field intelligence.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Would your engagement with your client have ended had you not turned to human intelligence?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I have no idea.  I mean, I can't speculate.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    Well, to clarify, when say you had exhausted the public documentation, are you saying you reached the end of your work or was there still more?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    No.  It's a broad project, there's lots of things going on.  We're pulling legal filings and bankruptcies and all sorts of other stuff on all kinds of issues.  I was talking about specific lines of inquiry.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    To the best of your knowledge, do Rinat Akhmetshin and Christopher Steele know each other?
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    I don't know.
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis

    We get calls from journalists who are working on stories about all kinds of subjects and some things we can answer questions on and others we don't.  I'm a former journalist, as I think you know, and we do lots of different kinds of research and people who are working on a story will call us and say what do you know about, you know, Carter Page and we'll say, well, here's the things that we know.

    It's hard to generalize.  I run a business, it's a research business.  Reporters know we have clients who pay us to do research.  So, you know, I don't remember any specific queries about whether we were being paid or not, but I think most journalists would assume that someone had paid us to do research.

    The word "they" is extremely broad.  Journalists would call and ask questions about specific things and from that they might conclude that we were doing a Trump oppo project.
  It's just worth pointing out that in a political season all kinds of people are doing research on all kinds of things.  Some people are interested in trade, other people are interested in guns.  So you wouldn't necessarily intuit exactly what we were doing.  Most people are interested in, you know -- they're interested in the story they're working on.  So some people will say, hey, I'm interested in whether Donald Trump gets his ties from third-world countries and they wouldn't ask about anything else.

    Sure.  Essentially there was -- at some point the controversy over the Trump campaign's possible relationship with the Kremlin became, you know, one of the main -- major issues in the campaign and there were things that Chris knew and understood to be the case that only he could really explain in a credible way, and I thought that -- we thought that he should be the one that explains them, you know.  So we sat down with a small group of reporters who were involved in investigative journalism of national security issues and we thought were in a position to make use of him as a resource.

    You said earlier that the information that you gather in your work is owned by the client, it's not owned by you, and so therefore you also referenced your nondisclosure agreements and that you felt like if you had information that related to national security or law enforcement that the nondisclosure agreement did not prevent you from disclosing that information to third parties.

    I think the issue we're trying to deal with is in order to assess your claims of privilege the committee needs to understand at least as much about the context of the dossier work as it does about the Prevezon work in terms of who was involved.  So if there's a law firm involved or if he was reporting to a law firm or acting under the direction of a law firm, then we need to be able to assess whether or not that was in anticipation of litigation, whether he was doing it by the direction of a law firm in order to assess your assertions of privilege.

He's been fully cooperative and he's here because the Chair and the Ranking Member agreed to a limited scope.

    There were several points in the interview where you made a point of saying your firm is not a Democratic linked firm in reference to the Sarah Huckabee Sanders quote.

    He's not going to talk about privileged discussions or agreements, and he's probably not qualified to answer anyway.

    Is Fusion GPS paying Cunningham Levy for the firm's representation of you or as a third party?

    That's privileged also.  He's not getting into payments to his lawyers and it's beyond the scope of this interview which has now gone on for almost nine hours.

    That's not correct.  The election was the end date.  I assume you're asking about the general election?  The election date would have been the end.

    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    So you didn't do any work on the Trump matter after the election date, that was the end of your work?

    I had no client after the election.
