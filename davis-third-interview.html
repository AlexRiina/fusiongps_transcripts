    <p>I believe he was.  I'm not certain of it.  The other person would have been a translator at some of these dinners.  I can't remember which ones.</p>

    <p>Were there any other individuals there involved with HRAGI or Prevezon work beyond the people you've mentioned?</p>

    <p>You're right.  At the hearing.</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>The hearing.  Before you were asking about the dinners, right?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>I was.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Now you're asking about the hearing.  I just want to be clear.  Well, it was a crowded hearing and there may have been other people involved.  I mean, I remember specifically pretty much most of the Baker legal team was there, Natalia was there, I believe she&mdash;I believe Anatoli was her translator for that.  There was some other people who I think were also from Baker Hostetler who were there.  Former Attorney General Mukasey was arguing for Prevezon.  So I just remember that there were lawyers&mdash;people who I believed were lawyers who were there to watch the argument and maybe had some connection to the case.  There was another associate I think from New York who was there, usually came to some of the Court hearings.  That's all I remember.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And the first dinner on the 8th were there any other attendees?</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson

    <p>I don't remember.  I think John Moscow might have been there.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And the second dinner on the 10th, were there any other attendees beyond the ones you've already described?</p>

     Mr. Simpson

     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>You mentioned that information Fusion had gathered may have been passed on to the HRAGI people via Baker Hostetler or if they instructed you to that you would have.  Did you have any expectation that that would reasonably result in them influencing U.S. policy?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I can't say that I would have specifically expected anything from that.  I was acting&mdash;lawyers hire me to do research for them, the research is their property or their client's property, it's not mine.  So if they want me to provide it to somebody else, it's their information.  So I would&mdash;it's a fairly ministerial thing.  I'm not sure I would have an expectation of any sort of specific result from that.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>But you did understand HRAGI to be lobbying on the Hill?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>They were registered to lobby on the Hill.  So I believe that's what they were doing, yeah.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>And did you understand that your actions on behalf of Prevezon or Baker Hostetler would principally benefit the Russian government?  Who did you believe the principal beneficiary to be?</p>

    <p>I'd like to note for the record that Patrick is smiling as he's asking the question.  You can answer.</p>

    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>We did not believe that was being done on behalf of the Russian government.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>What do you understand Prevezon's relationship, if any, to be with the Russian government?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Prevezon was introduced to me as the client and Denis Katsyv was the owner of Prevezon.  Generally speaking, when we take on a new case, you know, from a respected law firm part of the, you know, discussion is who's the client, and, you know, Mark Cymrot said they've checked out Denis Katsyv and he has&mdash;he's a legitimate businessman.  He's got a real estate company, it's a successful company, and he has an explanation for how he makes his money and appears to be legit.  To some extent whenever you enter a new case that's part of what you're being hired to determine is whether that initial due diligence stands up, but in any event, he was presented to me as a successful real estate investor.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I say, I worked with Baker Hostetler for a number of years and it's a conservative midwestern law firm with a lot of respected people in it, and part of the obligations of lawyers in this country and now in a lot of other countries is to determine where their money comes from and who their clients are and whether their clients are involved in criminal activity.  I don't remember the exact specifics of our discussions of these matters, but one of the issues was whether he's a legitimate businessman.</p>

     Mr. Davis

    <p>Did you ever receive a letter of inquiry from the Department of Justice regarding the applicability of the Foreign Agent Registration Act to your work on the Prevezon case or Magnitsky matter?</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    <p>I just want to make sure that employees involved in this matter are protected.  We've had death threats come to the company.  We'll be happy to cooperate with the committee and give the names of those people.  I just want to do it outside of this transcript, unless you're going to assure me the transcript is going to be kept confidential.</p>

     Mr. Davis

    <p>Whether he'd already started working with Mr. Steele during the time of the&mdash;</p>

    <p>During the time of the meetings in early June, right?  And your answer was?</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>The purpose of the trip was the hearing.  It was routine for me to attend hearings.  So I would bill them&mdash;my office would bill them for my train trips and hotels depending on whether there was&mdash;whether it was specifically for the Prevezon case.  I don't know if&mdash;I don't know for a fact that we billed them.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis

     Mr. Davis

    <p>So I think you've already stated that Ed Baumgartner worked on both projects, on the Prevezon project and another Trump investigation.  To the best of your knowledge, does Mr. Baumgartner know Rinat Akhmetshin?</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I don't know.  I'd just like to clarify, you know, my recollection is that Ed worked&mdash;the Prevezon thing wound down and I don't think I brought Ed on until it was either ending or had already ended.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis

    <p>Can you clarify the time frame for when it was winding down?</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>The hearing was on June 9th, I guess we said, and that was the culmination of a long controversy over whether Browder was going to have to testify and whether, you know, we had to be disqualified and, you know, there was a whole series of media attacks on us during that period from Browder.  Then nothing happened after that and that was, you know, sort of the peak of that.  It was after that that a lot of the issues involving Russia and the campaign started to heat up.</p>

     Mr. Simpson

    <p>I think the primary employees did not overlap, but I can't tell you that there was a Chinese wall of separation.  Various people specialize in certain things and can contribute ad hoc to something.</p>

    <p>One point I'd like to clarify from Ms. Sawyer's questioning.  I believe you said that Mr. Steele had told you that the FBI had a source from inside the Trump organization and I believe she referred to a source from inside the Trump campaign.  Do you know which is the accurate&mdash;</p>

    <p>I think I was saying we did not have the detailed conversations where he would debrief me on his discussions with the FBI.

     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>I'm going to have you take a look at one of the filings by Mr. Steele's attorneys in the lawsuit against him and Orbis in the United Kingdom.  This will be Exhibit 4.  If you could please turn to page 2 and read paragraph No. 8.  That paragraph states "At all material times Fusion was subject to an obligation not to disclose to third parties confidential intelligence material provided to it by the Defendants in the course of that working relationship without the agreement of the Defendants."  Is that a correct description of your understanding of how the material was to be treated?</p>

   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Muse

    <p>Sure.  The Defendants are Orbis Business Intelligence Limited and Christopher Steele.</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">

    <p>What's the question?</p>

    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Is that an accurate description of what you understood the obligations to be with that material?</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I mean, that's hard for me to answer.  There's a mutual expectation of confidentiality, and if that's what you read that as saying, then yes, there's a mutual expectation of confidentiality.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis

    <p>Was that expectation established by contract?</p>

   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Was any of the information included in the memoranda Orbis prepared during the Trump investigation not considered "confidential intelligence" under this understanding such that Fusion was not required to obtain Orbis's permission in order to disclose it?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I don't really understand the question.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>I'm saying if the understanding is that you weren't to disclose confidential intelligence material, were the memos confidential intelligence material, the dossier memos?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>They're confidential, yes.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Muse
    </author>
    <p>Hold on one second.  Here's the mischief that's created by that.  Someone else is sending this and you're asking what they mean.  There may be direct answers to those questions if you ask direct questions, but to do it in the frame of reference of someone else putting forth a piece of evidence, which this is, it inevitably creates confusion.  The reference to the document adds nothing to his knowledge.  It's just simply a point of reference by you, but it doesn't add anything to what he might be saying.  So I think the better way to get at it is simply to ask direct questions.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>There are two parties to this, at least, and we've got one's description.  I'd like to know if he agrees with that description.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Muse
    </author>
    <p>But even within what do they mean by this is the question.  I mean, what do they mean by this sort of paragraph.  You're asking him for an interpretation.  He can answer questions about the relationship.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>I'm asking him to give an interpretation of their agreement in terms of what he did.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Muse
    </author>
    <p>And therein lies the problem.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>But if it's an agreement to which he's a party, there's a basis for that understanding.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Muse
    </author>
    <p>I don't think that's the way the rule works.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>Well, I think the bigger mischief from my point of view is the fact that we're trying to get an understanding of what the contractual relationship was.  You're telling us you're not going to provide us with details about that contractual relationship, you're not going to provide us with copies of any nondisclosure agreements, contracts we've asked for and we don't have.  So we're asking him for his understanding of what obligations he had.</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    <p>That's not what I said.  You had made a comment about contracts, and I just wanted to make sure that obviously the Chair and the Ranking Member have agreed those questions are not part of the scope of this interview.  That said, I've now forgotten what the pending question was.  So if Patrick wants to restate it he can and we can evaluate it.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Sure.  In general we're asking questions about distribution of the material within the dossier which was the scope of the agreement.  If you look at page 4 of that same exhibit, paragraph 30, Steele's attorneys state "The Defendants"&mdash;and again, that's Orbis Business Intelligence and Christopher Steele&mdash;"did not however provide any of the pre-election memoranda to any of the media or journalists, nor did they authorize anyone to do so, nor did they provide the confidential December memorandum to media organizations or journalists, nor did they authorize anyone to do so."</p>
    <p>To the best of your knowledge, did Orbis ever authorize Fusion to make any disclosures of the memoranda to the media?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy

    <p>Just before we get into this question, this paragraph began with a sentence you did not read and it says "In the first sentence of subparagraph 8.2.5 as noted."  I don't know what they're referring to.  Maybe you do.  Can you show us that?</p>

    <author>
     Mr. Davis

   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster

    <p>I think what I said was I had spoken with reporters over the course of the summer and through the fall about the investigations by the government and the controversy over connections between&mdash;alleged connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians.  Some of what we discussed was informed by Chris's reporting.  So whether that was&mdash;I don't think there's any sense that that was an unauthorized thing to do.</p>

    <p>On page 5 of that same exhibit, paragraph 32 there's a portion of the sentence&mdash;and I'll just read this for background before we move on to another segment.  I think this is relevant for context.  There's a portion here in which Steele's attorneys state that he gave&mdash;that the Defendants gave "Off-the-record briefings to a small number of journalists about the pre-election memoranda in late summer/autumn 2016."

    <p>So with the second one on page 8 of Exhibit 5, under the response to 18 Steele's attorneys state "The journalists initially briefed at the end of September 2016 by the second Defendant and Fusion at Fusion's instruction were from the New York Times, the Washington Post, Yahoo News, the New Yorker, and CNN.  The second Defendant"&mdash;that would be Mr. Steele&mdash;"subsequently participated in further meetings at Fusion's instruction with Fusion and the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Yahoo News which took place in mid-October 2016.  In each of those cases the briefing was conducted verbally in person.  In addition, and again at Fusion's instruction, in late October 2016 the second Defendant briefed the journalist from Mother Jones by Skype.  No copies of the pre-election memoranda were ever shown or provided to any journalist by or with the authorization of the Defendants.  The briefings involved the disclosure of limited intelligence regarding indications of Russian interference in the U.S. election process and the possible coordination of members of Trump's campaign team and Russian government officials."</p>
    <p>To the best of your knowledge, is that a full and accurate account of all the news organizations with which Fusion and Mr. Steele shared information from the memoranda.</p>

If Chris specifically said something to me about showing this to one of his government officials I don't remember it.  So...</p>

    <p>So after the election obviously we were as surprised as everyone else and Chris and I were mutually concerned about whether the United States had just elected someone who was compromised by a hostile foreign power, more in my case whether the election had been tainted by an intervention by the Russian intelligence services, and we were, you know, unsure what to do.  Initially we didn't do anything other than to discuss our concerns, but we were gravely concerned.</p>

     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>some point a few weeks after the election Chris called me and said that he had received an inquiry from David Kramer, who was a long-time advisor to Senator McCain, and that according to&mdash;Kramer told Chris that he had run into Sir Andrew Wood at a security conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia and that Kramer was accompanying Senator McCain to this conference and that the three of them had had an unscheduled or unplanned encounter where the issue of this research was discussed and the essence of it, I guess, was conveyed to Senator McCain and to David Kramer from Andrew Wood.  I don't remember whether Andrew Wood's name was specifically given to me by Christopher Steele at that time.  It was later given to me.  It later became an accepted fact that Chris had mentioned him to me.  I believe he probably mentioned it.</p>
    <p>But anyway, he did say someone that he worked with in the past who was a former UK government official with experience in Russia had had this conversation with David Kramer and John McCain and that Senator McCain had followed up on it as to what more there was to know about these allegations, this information.</p>
    <p>So Chris asked me do you know David Kramer, and I said yes, I've known David Kramer for a long time.  David Kramer is part of a small group of people that I'm sort of loosely affiliated with.  We've all worked on Russia and are very concerned about kleptocracy and human rights and the police state that Russia has become, in particular the efforts of the Russians to corrupt and mess with our political system.  So we shared this concern going back to when I was at the Wall Street Journal and that's how I met David.  He was working at the State Department as assistant secretary for human rights, and I was reporting on human rights and corruption in Russia.</p>
    <p>So I told Chris he's legit.  David is someone I've known for a long time and he knows a lot about these issues and he's very concerned about Putin and the Kremlin and the rise of the new Russia and criminality and kleptocracy.  So he said, well, can we trust him?  And I said yes, I think we can trust him.  He says he wants information to give to Senator McCain so that Senator McCain can ask questions about it at the FBI, with the leadership of the FBI.  That was essentially&mdash;all we sort of wanted was for the government to do its job and we were concerned about whether the information that we provided previously had ever, you know, risen to the leadership level of the FBI.  We simply just didn't know.  It was our belief that Director Comey if he was aware&mdash;if he was made aware of this information would treat it seriously.</p>
    <p>Again, at this time, you know, while we believed that we had very credible reporting here, you know, what we really&mdash;we just wanted people in official positions to ascertain whether it was accurate or not.  You know, we just felt that was our obligation.  So I said to Chris I think we can trust him, and he said okay.  Well, he was here, I met with him, and I told him what happened.  Now he's back in Washington and, you know, I'm going to hand him to you.</p>
    <p>I don't remember whether I called David or David called me, I just don't remember, but we got in touch and he, you know, asked me&mdash;we met.</p>

     Mr. Davis

    <p>Did Mr. Steele represent to you that Orbis or Mr. Wood had initiated this contact with Mr. Kramer and Mr. McCain to share the dossier information?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>Well, that has two parts on that question.  I think I can answer the first part which I think answers the second.  Anyway, he did not describe this as having been initiated by Orbis.  He described this as a chance encounter at a security conference where, you know, someone who had some knowledge of these matters shared it with Senator McCain and David Kramer and that caused David Kramer to follow up with Chris and that it was passive.  In other words, it was initiated by Mr. Kramer.</p>

    <p>According to the official attendee list for that conference, Mr. Akhmetshin was also there.  To the best of your knowledge, was he involved in any capacity in the effort to discuss the dossier information with Mr. Kramer and Mr. McCain?</p>

     Mr. Davis

    <p>Did any Fusion employees communicate with any foreign governments or foreign intelligence agencies about the memoranda or the information contained therein?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson

    <p>I don't believe so, certainly not knowingly.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Did you and Mr. Steele ever discuss any communications he had with foreign government officials about the information in the memoranda?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>It would be difficult&mdash;nothing specific that I recall.  There are parts of the memos that talk about information that foreign government officials provided in the course of their research, but beyond what's in the memos I don't really have any recollection.</p>
   </bubble>

    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>Do you know who paid for Mr. Steele's trip to Rome to meet with the FBI?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I have read recently that&mdash;I think in a letter from Senator Grassley that the FBI reimbursed the expense, but to be clear, I mean, that's it.  He was, to my knowledge, not been compensated for that work or any other work during this time.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Foster
    </author>
    <p>I'm sorry.  You're saying that Fusion did not pay for the trip?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Levy
    </author>
    <p>Go ahead and answer the question.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>I don't think we did.  I have no information that we paid for it.  Again, this sort of emphasizes, you know, the point I was making earlier which was this was something that I considered to be something that Chris took on on his own based on his professional obligations and not something that was part of my project.  So it makes sense to me that he was reimbursed by them, not us.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>To clarify, you were saying his interactions with the FBI were not part of your project?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>They obviously grew out of the project, but as he explained it to me, you know, when you learn things in your daily life that raise national security considerations you're obligated to report them.  So that wouldn't have anything to do with my client's goals or project.</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble>
    <author>
     Mr. Davis
    </author>
    <p>But in your briefings with journalists you did reference his interactions&mdash;Mr. Steele's interactions with the FBI, correct?</p>
   </bubble>
   <bubble class="interviewee">
    <author>
     Mr. Simpson
    </author>
    <p>At some point that occurred, but I don't believe it occurred until very late in the process.</p>

    <author>
     Mr. Davis

    <p>Can you estimate when in the process?</p>

   <bubble class="interviewee">

     Mr. Simpson

    <p>It was probably the last few days before the election or immediately thereafter.</p>
